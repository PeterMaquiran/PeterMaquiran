## Peter Maquiran

I'm a Web & Mobile Developer focused on building reliable, observable, and offline-ready applications. I work mainly with Angular, Vue, Ionic, Flutter and Node.js, crafting smooth experiences that stay fast — even with poor connectivity.

I care deeply about observability and performance, using OpenTelemetry, Zipkin, Prometheus, and Grafana to trace and monitor systems end-to-end. I also manage Docker-based infrastructure with Nginx, Certbot, and automated CI/CD pipelines for secure, zero-downtime deployments.

I love turning complex systems into simple, dependable apps — where every request, metric, and trace tells a store
